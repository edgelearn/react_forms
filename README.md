# ReactJS Forms

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn start
```

Make all of the following changes to the my-app/src/App.js file, you will need to use the skills you have learned in JavaScript as well as state/event handlers in ReactJS.

1. Add an input component that only allows the user to enter in numbers.

2. Add a dropdown component that has the past 10 years including this year as the possible options. Do not hard code the years.

3. Add a checkbox to the page

4. Add radio buttons that are disabled if the checkbox is not checked.

5. Add a form tag around all of the input fields and a submit button, preventing the form to submit through the event handler.

6. Apply a CSS class name to the input field based upon if it has focus or not.

7. Add another input field that allows the user to type anything, but perform validation when the field loses focus or the form is submitted to make sure that it is an email address. If it is not an email address, display a message below the input field.

8. Add labels to all of the fields you previously added, making sure they have tags for accessibility.

After you have completed all of the exercises, commit your changes with the following command:

```
git commit -am "ReactJS Forms Examples"
```
